    "#### What is NLP, Why it is Important\n",
    "    - NLP, or Natural Language Processing, is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers \n",
    "      to understand, interpret, and generate human language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to fill the gap between \n",
    "      human communication and computer understanding, allowing machines to interact with people in a way that is both\n",
    "      meaningful and natural.\n",
    "    - It helps developers organize knowledge for performing tasks such as translation, automatic summarization, named \n",
    "      entity recognition, speech recognition, relation extraction, and topic segmentation. These are applications of NLP.\n",
    "    - Why it is Important :- NLP can analyze large volumes of text data, helping businesses gain insights from customer \n",
    "                             reviews, social media posts, or articles.\n",
    "                           - Voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant understand and respond to spoken commands, \n",
    "                             making it easy for users to interact with their devices using natural language.\n",
    "                           - Translation apps use NLP to convert text from one language to another, facilitating \n",

    "                           - Chatbots on websites or messaging apps use NLP to understand user queries and provide \n",

    "                           - Companies use NLP to analyze customer feedback and reviews to understand the sentiment \n",

    "                           - NLP algorithms can summarize lengthy articles or documents, providing users with relevant \n",

       "'No comment is expected from Barack Obama Members of the #FYF911 or #FukYoFlag and #BlackLivesMatter movements called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops. They encouraged others on a radio show Tuesday night to  turn the tide  and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in America.One of the F***YoFlag organizers is called  Sunshine.  She has a radio blog show hosted from Texas called,  Sunshine s F***ing Opinion Radio Show. A snapshot of her #FYF911 @LOLatWhiteFear Twitter page at 9:53 p.m. shows that she was urging supporters to  Call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white Below is a SNAPSHOT Twitter Radio Call Invite   #FYF911The radio show aired at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time.During the show, callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people.A 2:39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here. It was provided to Breitbart Texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  Hannibal.  He has already received death threats as a result of interrupting #FYF911 conference calls.An unidentified black man said  when those mother f**kers are by themselves, that s when when we should start f***ing them up. Like they do us, when a bunch of them ni**ers takin  one of us out, that s how we should roll up.  He said,  Cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. There should be six or seven black mother f**ckers, see that white person, and then lynch their ass. Let s turn the tables. They conspired that if  cops started losing people,  then  there will be a state of emergency. He speculated that one of two things would happen,  a big-ass [R s?????] war,  or  ni**ers, they are going to start backin  up. We are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? Sunshine could be heard saying,  Yep, that s true. That s so f**king true. He said,  We need to turn the tables on them. Our kids are getting shot out here. Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.He said,  Everybody ain t down for that s**t, or whatever, but like I say, everybody has a different position of war.  He continued,  Because they don t give a f**k anyway.  He said again,  We might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. He said, that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties, and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. They are out their killing black people, black lives don t matter, that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. Find a mother f**ker that is alone. Snap his ass, and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. We  just need one example,  and  then people will start watchin .  This will turn the tables on s**t, he said. He said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging,  that will start the  trickle-down effect.  He continued,  Black people are good at starting trends. He said that was how  to get the upper-hand. Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. The first black male said,  That will be the best method right there. Breitbart Texas previously reported how Sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls. She subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators. The veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls.One of the #F***YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call,  We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. Breitbart Texas previously encountered Sunshine at a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas, where she said all white people should be killed. She told journalists and photographers,  You see this nappy-ass hair on my head?   That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.  She said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother-f**kers murdered Sandra Bland because she had nappy hair like me. #FYF911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on September 11th accountable on that day, as reported by Breitbart Texas. There are several websites and Twitter handles for the movement. Palmetto Star  describes himself as one of the head organizers. He said in a YouTube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority,  their  false white supremacy,  like the American flag, the British flag, police uniforms, and Ku Klux Klan hoods.Sierra McGrone or  Nocturnus Libertus  posted,  you too can help a young Afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.  She posted two photos, one that appears to be herself, and a photo of a black man, wiping their naked butts with the American flag.For entire story: Breitbart News'"

    "#### when to use what :-\n",
    "    - Stemming:\n",
    "        - Use Case: Stemming is often used when the focus is on simplicity and speed. It involves removing prefixes \n",
    "          or suffixes from words to get to the word stem.\n",
    "        - Example Context: In a chatting application's name suggestion feature, where quick and efficient suggestions \n",
    "          are crucial, stemming might be preferred.\n",
    "    - Lemmatization:\n",
    "        - Use Case: Lemmatization is used when the goal is to obtain meaningful words by reducing them to their base \n",
    "          or root form (lemma).\n",
    "        - Example Context: In voice or language applications, where the emphasis is on providing meaningful suggestions\n",
    "          or understanding user input accurately, lemmatization might be more suitable.\n",
    "    * To elaborate further:\n",
    "    - Stemming Example (in a chatting application):\n",
    "        - Original: \"running\"\n",
    "        - Stem: \"run\"\n",
    "    - Lemmatization Example (in voice or language applications):\n",
    "        - Original: \"better\" (adjective)\n",
    "        - Lemma: \"good\"\n",
    "    - In summary, the choice between stemming and lemmatization depends on the specific requirements of the application.\n",
    "      Stemming is often chosen for its simplicity and speed, while lemmatization is preferred when maintaining the meaning\n",
    "      of words is crucial, such as in language understanding tasks.\n",
    "    - if spped is focused then we will use Stemming ex :- in chatting application name suggestion \n",
    "    - if we want meaningfull word then we will use Lemmatization :- if voice or language applications we use Lemmatization"
